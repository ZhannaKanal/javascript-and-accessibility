Understanding aria-expanded, aria-live and Common Aria States
How make dynamic and interactive content accessible
In real-world apps, content is rarely static, and pages often update dynamically through JavaScript.
<button id="menuButton" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="menuList">
Menu
</button>

<ul id="menuList" hidden>
  <li>List item 1</li>
  <li>List item 2</li>
</ul>
<script src="index.js"></script>
const button = document.getElementById("menuButton");
const menu = document.getElementById("menuList");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const expanded = button.getAttribute("aria-expanded") === "true";
  button.setAttribute("aria-expanded", String(!expanded));
  menu.hidden = expanded;
});
The HTML sets up a button that controls a dropdown menu. The button uses aria-expanded to indicate whether the menu is open, and aria-controls to link it to the menu by referencing the menu's id.

aria-expanded Attribute, how does it work
The aria-expanded attribute is used for accessibility purposes to indicate if a control is expanded or collapsed. It's used in conjunction with collapsible widgets like menus, accordions and other  disclosure widgets that control the visibility of content. The aria-expanded attribute is set to true if the control is expanded, or false if it is collapsed.
<button aria-expanded="true">Menu</button> expanded
<button aria-expanded="false">Menu</button> collapsed

Aria-controls attribute is used to specify the element being controlled. 
F/e: a button might expand or collapse a list acting as a menu. 
The value of aria-controls will be the id of the controlled element.

If it is not possible to place the expanded content immediately after the controlling element, the aria-owns attribute allows you to virtually move it after the control in the accessibility tree.
This allows assistive technology like screen readers to pretend the expanded content is placed directly after the control in the DOM.
When you use either aria-controls or aria-owns, the value of aria-expanded must be continue to be updated as the control is expanded and collapsed.
By using aria-expanded correctly, you can create an intuitive user experience for everyone.

aria-live Attribute, how does it work
The aria-live attribute creates a live region on your page which can be used to notify screen reader users of dynamic content changes in the live region as they occur.
error message or confirmation
tricker, marquee, countdown timer
aria-live="assertive" means that the update is very important, highest priority, user notified immediately.
aria-live="polite" means that the update is not urgent, so the screen reader can wait until any current announcement is finished or until the user stops typing before announcing the update.
aria-live="off" means that the update will not be announced unless the content is in an element that currently has keyboard focus.

Aria States used on Custom Control Elements
disabled attribute to disable a button or the 
checked attribute to indicate that a checkbox is checked
but if you are creating a custom control element, 
you need to use ARIA attributes to convey the state 
of the control to assistive technologies

aria-selected="true" used to indicate that an element is aria-selected
tabbed interface, a listbox, or a grid
aria-disabled="true" used to indicate that an element is disabled 
only to people using assistive technologies.
